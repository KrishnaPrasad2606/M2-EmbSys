# INTRODUCTION
Automatic street light system is a simple concept which uses LDR. By this system manual works are completely removed . It automatically switches on lights when the light goes below ambient light . This is done using LDR which senses the light.

# LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTOR
It automatically switches ON lights when the sunlight goes below the visible region of our eyes. It automatically switches OFF lights when Sunlight fall on it ( i.e on LDR ) e.g in morning, by using a sensor called LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) which senses the light just like our eyes.

# LED
LED, in full light-emitting diode, in electronics, a semiconductor device that emits infrared or visible light when charged with an electric current. Visible LEDs are used in many electronic devices as indicator lamps, in automobiles as rear-window and brake lights, and on billboards and signs as alphanumeric displays or even full-colour posters. Infrared LEDs are employed in autofocus cameras and television remote controls and also as light sources in fibre-optic telecommunication systems.

# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENT
HR-1 It automatically switches ON lights when the sunlight goes below the visible region of our eyes. (e.g in evening after Sunset). 

HR-2 It automatically switches OFF lights when Sunlight fall on it  ( i.e on LDR ) e.g in morning, by using a sensor called LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) which senses the light just like our eyes.

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENT
LR-1 LDR is connected to a voltage divider circuit.

LR-2 The LDR output is given to the micro controller to to take decisions wheather to turn on or turn off LED.
